Design process for developing a Space Weather Forecasting data pipeline 

# Space Weather Forecasting System  

## Project Overview  
This is a design project focused on building a data pipeline for space weather forecasting. The system processes data from magnetograms, EUV images, X-ray time series, proton flux time series, and active region patches to generate predictive analytics.  

## Data Pipeline Functions  
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Continuously fetches and processes space weather data.  
- **Data Cleaning & Synchronization:** Ensures consistency across different data sources.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses an ensemble of models to forecast space weather events.  
- **Storage & Retrieval:** Outputs predictions to a database for visualization and analysis.  
- **System Monitoring:** Logs errors and reports connectivity issues.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend:** Python, SQL  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, PHP, CSS  
- **Visualization:** MATLAB, Tableau  
- **Data Handling:** JSON for structured storage and exchange
